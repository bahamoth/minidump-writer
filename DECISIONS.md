# Part 1: Decision Recording Protocol

## Agent Identification
Every decision MUST record participating agents using the role-name format:
- **Format**: `role-name` (e.g., architect-stark, coder-parker, boss-human)
- **Getting ID**: Ask "What is your role and name?" at session start
- **Roles**: architect, coder, reviewer, boss, analyst, etc.

## Decision ID Scheme
- **Format**: `D-YYYY-MM-DD-##` where ## increments daily
- **Example**: D-2025-07-17-01 (first decision on July 17, 2025)
- **Permanence**: IDs are permanent; never reuse

## Decision Template
```markdown
## D-YYYY-MM-DD-## - [Decision Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Approved | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Recording Guidelines
1. **Append-Only**: Never delete or modify existing decisions
2. **Ordering**: Add new decisions at the top of Part 2
3. **Superseding**: Mark old decisions as "Superseded" with reference
4. **Cross-References**: Always link to relevant R-IDs and T-IDs
5. **Conflicts**: When architects disagree, record all viewpoints

## D-2025-07-28-01 - Thread Priority Handling in iOS/macOS Minidumps

**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Participants**:
  - Proposers: dev-zatanna, reviewer-ritchie
  - Decider: reviewer-ritchie
  - Implementer: dev-zatanna

**Context**: 
macOS/iOS does not provide direct thread priority values like Windows. The THREAD_BASIC_INFO structure only contains a `policy` field that indicates the scheduling algorithm (TIMESHARE, FIFO, RR), not the actual priority. Getting actual priority requires additional thread_info() calls with policy-specific flavors, which adds complexity and potential failure points.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Use policy field as proxy for priority** (implemented by dev-zatanna)
   - Store scheduling policy (0-2) in MDRawThread.priority field
   - Pros: Simple implementation, no extra syscalls, avoids potential failures
   - Cons: Not actual priority value, may confuse cross-platform analysis tools

2. **Make additional syscalls for actual priority** (considered)
   - Call thread_info() again with THREAD_SCHED_TIMESHARE_INFO/FIFO_INFO/RR_INFO
   - Extract cur_priority field (0-127 range)
   - Pros: More accurate priority representation
   - Cons: Extra syscalls per thread, complex error handling, performance impact

3. **Store zero in priority field** (considered)
   - Set priority to 0 for all threads
   - Pros: Clear that priority is not available
   - Cons: Loses any thread scheduling information

**Decision**: 
Selected Option 1: Use policy field as proxy for priority. This provides some thread scheduling information without adding complexity or failure points.

**Rationale**:
- Minidump generation should be fast and reliable, especially during crash handling
- Additional syscalls per thread could impact performance and add failure points
- The policy field still provides useful information about thread scheduling behavior
- Cross-platform tools already need OS-specific interpretation of priority values
- Comment clearly documents the limitation for consumers

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Simple, reliable implementation without extra syscalls
- Positive: Maintains some thread scheduling information
- Negative: Priority field doesn't contain actual priority values
- Negative: May require education for minidump consumers about platform differences
- Follow-up: Document this behavior in public API documentation

**Implementation Note**:
The code includes a detailed comment explaining this decision:
```rust
// Priority is a complex calculation on macOS/iOS. The `policy` field is used here as a proxy for `priority`
// because macOS/iOS does not provide a direct thread priority value. The `policy` field represents the
// scheduling policy of the thread (e.g., timesharing, fixed priority, etc.), and its numeric value can
// vary depending on the system's implementation. Consumers of this value should be aware that it is not
// a direct priority metric but rather an approximation based on the thread's scheduling policy.
```

**Relates-To**: T-009 (iOS minidump writer implementation)
**Supersedes**: None

## D-2025-07-18-01 - Apple Common Module Restructuring

**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Participants**:
  - Proposers: architect-stark, boss-human
  - Decider: architect-stark
  - Implementer: architect-stark

**Context**: 
Initial iOS implementation (PR#1) revealed significant code duplication between macOS and iOS. The macOS MinidumpWriter already supports self-process dumping, making a separate iOS implementation unnecessary. Need to restructure to share common code while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Keep Separate iOS Implementation** (initial approach)
   - Maintain src/ios/ with duplicate code
   - Pros: Clear separation, no risk to existing macOS code
   - Cons: Code duplication, maintenance burden, memory leak already found

2. **Direct Reuse of macOS Code** (proposed by architect-stark)
   - Use macOS MinidumpWriter directly for iOS
   - Pros: No duplication, proven code
   - Cons: iOS-specific constraints mixed with macOS code

3. **Apple Common Module Pattern** (proposed by boss-human)
   - Create apple/common for shared code, apple/mac and apple/ios for platform-specific
   - Maintain backward compatibility through re-exports
   - Pros: Clean architecture, code reuse, maintainable, Rust idiomatic
   - Cons: Requires careful restructuring

**Decision**: 
Selected Option 3: Apple Common Module Pattern. This provides the best balance of code reuse, maintainability, and platform-specific customization.

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates code duplication discovered in PR#1 review
- Follows Rust idiomatic patterns for platform abstraction
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility through re-exports
- Allows iOS-specific adaptations without polluting macOS code
- Fixes memory leak (vm_deallocate) in shared code benefits both platforms

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clean architecture, reduced maintenance, shared bug fixes
- Positive: Better code organization following Rust conventions
- Negative: Initial complexity in restructuring
- Follow-up: iOS-specific TaskDumper still needed for platform constraints

**Implementation Details** (commit 90e4c70b):
- Created src/apple/ module structure:
  - apple/common/ - shared implementations
  - apple/mac/ - macOS-specific code  
  - apple/ios/ - iOS-specific code (deleted after migration)
- Maintained backward compatibility:
  - src/mac.rs re-exports apple::mac
  - src/lib.rs provides original public API
- Fixed memory leak in TaskDumper::read_thread_info
- All tests pass without modification

**Relates-To**: T-001, PR#1
**Supersedes**: None

## D-2025-07-17-01 - iOS Architecture Pattern Selection

**Status**: Approved
**Date**: 2025-07-17
**Participants**:
  - Proposers: architect-claude, architect-stark
  - Decider: architect-claude
  - Implementer: coder-parker

**Context**: 
The iOS implementation needs to adapt the existing macOS architecture while respecting iOS platform constraints including sandboxing, signal safety requirements, and the inability to inspect external processes.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Direct Port from macOS** (proposed by architect-stark)
   - Copy macOS implementation with minimal changes
   - Pros: Fast implementation, code reuse, proven patterns
   - Cons: Won't work due to iOS restrictions, external process inspection impossible

2. **Self-Process Only with Signal Safety** (proposed by architect-claude)
   - Focus on self-process dumping with signal-safe implementation
   - Use pre-allocated buffers and async-signal-safe functions
   - Pros: Works within iOS constraints, crash-safe, follows platform guidelines
   - Cons: Limited to self-process, more complex implementation

3. **Hybrid with Runtime Detection** (proposed by architect-stark)
   - Detect capabilities at runtime and adapt behavior
   - Pros: Flexible, could support jailbroken devices
   - Cons: Complex, App Store rejection risk, maintenance burden

**Decision**: 
Selected Option 2: Self-Process Only with Signal Safety. This approach respects iOS platform constraints while providing reliable crash reporting capabilities.

**Rationale**:
- iOS sandboxing makes external process inspection impossible
- Signal safety is critical for crash handling reliability
- Aligns with App Store guidelines and security model
- Similar approach used by successful iOS crash reporters

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Reliable crash capture, App Store compliant, maintainable
- Negative: Limited to self-process dumps, no external process support
- Follow-up: Implement pre-allocated buffer system (T-201), signal-safe writers (T-202)

**Relates-To**: R-100, R-101, R-102
**Supersedes**: None
