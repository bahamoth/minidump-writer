# Task: T-010 - Add iOS simulator support
Agent: architect-forge
Date: 2025-07-26

## Pre-Implementation
- [x] Read ARCHITECTURE.md relevant sections
- [x] Read PRD.md for requirements (if applicable)
- [x] Review existing similar implementations
- [x] Plan approach

## Implementation
- [x] Update build.rs to detect iOS simulator targets
- [x] Add ios-simulator feature flag to Cargo.toml
- [x] Add conditional compilation in system_info.rs for simulator architecture detection
- [x] Create example demonstrating platform detection
- [ ] Fix existing iOS build errors (blocking full testing)
- [ ] Add simulator-specific test cases
- [ ] Update documentation

## Pre-Commit Validation
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt`
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` - fix ALL warnings
- [ ] Run `cargo test` - ensure all pass
- [ ] Self-review changes

## Pre-Push Validation
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` final check
- [ ] Verify no new warnings introduced

## Finalization
- [ ] Update TASKS.md status
- [ ] Create PR with proper description
- [ ] Link PR to task in TASKS.md

## Notes
- iOS simulator targets are detected by checking for "-sim" suffix in TARGET env var
- Both x86_64 (Intel) and aarch64 (Apple Silicon) simulator architectures are supported
- The cfg!(ios_simulator) flag is now available for conditional compilation
- iOS implementation has existing build errors that need to be fixed separately
